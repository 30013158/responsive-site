            <h3>Who we are?</h3>
            <p>We are a group of dedicated teachers who help students to build their confidence in studies and make
                them to realise them about their potentials to do the hardest things. We have such a positive
                environment at our center that even unwilling students eventually become passionate about education.
                We also provide free coaching to the students who have really sparkling abilities but cannot afford
                their studies.

        <p>EasyLearning also provides an opportunity to students, tutors to teach for a social cause. Every child
            has a right to study but every child cannot meet the expenses of expensive tuition centers. Although the
            cost of studying at EasyLearning is very cheap, but we select 30 students every year and teach them for
            free. So, we have the volunteer work here for teachers and students as well to bring out their teaching
            skills.<br><br>
